        "content": "Next.js 14: New App Router Features\n\nNext.js 14 marks an important milestone in the evolution of the most popular React framework. With the App Router now stable, developers can create more performant and maintainable applications.\n\nKey New Features\n\nStable App Router: The App Router, introduced experimentally in Next.js 13, is now stable and production-ready. This new routing approach offers folder-based routing that's more intuitive and organized, nested layouts for optimized component reuse, and Server Components by default for improved performance.\n\nTurbopack (Alpha): Turbopack, Webpack's successor written in Rust, promises compilation times up to 10x faster. This revolutionary improvement allows developers to see their changes instantly.\n\nServer Actions: Server Actions allow executing server-side code directly from client components, dramatically simplifying database and API interactions.\n\nMigration from Pages Router\n\nMigrating to the App Router requires some structural adjustments:\n\n```javascript\n// Old: pages/index.js\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>Home</h1>\n}\n\n// New: app/page.js\nexport default function Page() {\n  return <h1>Home</h1>\n}\n```\n\nKey Benefits\n\nImproved performance with faster page loading, optimized SEO for better natural referencing, enhanced developer experience with more intuitive development tools, and better scalability through more robust architecture for large applications.\n\nBest Practices\n\nStart with Server Components and use client components only when needed. Leverage streaming to implement progressive loading. Optimize images using Next.js Image component. Cache strategically by implementing proper caching strategies.\n\nPerformance Improvements\n\nThe new architecture provides reduced JavaScript bundle size, better Core Web Vitals scores, improved Time to Interactive (TTI), and enhanced First Contentful Paint (FCP).\n\nNext.js 14 with stable App Router represents the future of React development. Teams migrating now will benefit from better performance, improved developer experience, and a more modern architecture for their web projects.",

        "content": "React Server Components: Complete Guide 2024\n\nReact Server Components (RSC) revolutionize how we build React applications by enabling server-side rendering of specific components.\n\nWhat are Server Components?\n\nServer Components are React components that run exclusively on the server. They offer major advantages: reduced JavaScript bundle (code isn't sent to the client), direct data access with direct connection to databases, and enhanced security as API keys stay server-side.\n\nServer vs Client Components\n\nServer Components:\n```javascript\n// app/posts/page.js (Server Component by default)\nimport { getPosts } from '@/lib/database'\n\nexport default async function PostsPage() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {posts.map(post => (\n        <article key={post.id}>\n          <h2>{post.title}</h2>\n          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>\n        </article>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nClient Components:\n```javascript\n'use client'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n      Counter: {count}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nBest Practices\n\nUse Server Components by default unless interactivity is needed. Minimize Client Components to reduce client-side JavaScript. Use smart composition to efficiently combine both types.\n\nPractical Use Cases\n\n```javascript\n// Server Component for data\nasync function UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const user = await fetchUser(userId)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <UserActions user={user} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nPerformance Optimization\n\nServer Components enable reduced Time to Interactive (TTI), improved First Contentful Paint (FCP), decreased JavaScript bundle size, and better SEO naturally.\n\nArchitecture Benefits\n\nZero client-side JavaScript for static content, automatic code splitting at component level, streaming support for progressive loading, and better caching strategies with server-side rendering.\n\nReact Server Components represent the future of React development. By mastering this technology, you'll create faster, more secure, and more maintainable applications.",

        "content": "TypeScript: Best Practices for 2024\n\nTypeScript continues to evolve and establish itself as the standard for modern JavaScript development. Here are the essential best practices for 2024.\n\nStrict Configuration\n\nOptimal tsconfig.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUncheckedIndexedAccess\": true,\n    \"exactOptionalPropertyTypes\": true,\n    \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdvanced Utility Types\n\nConditional Types:\n```typescript\ntype ApiResponse<T> = T extends string \n  ? { message: T } \n  : { data: T }\n\ntype StringResponse = ApiResponse<string> // { message: string }\ntype DataResponse = ApiResponse<User[]>   // { data: User[] }\n```\n\nMapped Types:\n```typescript\ntype Partial<T> = {\n  [P in keyof T]?: T[P]\n}\n```\n\nModern Patterns\n\nBranded Types:\n```typescript\ntype UserId = string & { __brand: 'UserId' }\ntype Email = string & { __brand: 'Email' }\n\nfunction createUser(id: UserId, email: Email) {\n  // Type safety guaranteed\n}\n```\n\nDiscriminated Unions:\n```typescript\ntype LoadingState = \n  | { status: 'loading' }\n  | { status: 'success'; data: any }\n  | { status: 'error'; error: string }\n\nfunction handleState(state: LoadingState) {\n  switch (state.status) {\n    case 'loading': return 'Loading...'\n    case 'success': return state.data\n    case 'error': return state.error\n  }\n}\n```\n\nValidation with Zod\n\n```typescript\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n\nconst UserSchema = z.object({\n  id: z.string().uuid(),\n  email: z.string().email(),\n  age: z.number().min(0).max(120)\n})\n\ntype User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>\n```\n\nEfficient Type Guards\n\n```typescript\nfunction isString(value: unknown): value is string {\n  return typeof value === 'string'\n}\n\nfunction processValue(value: unknown) {\n  if (isString(value)) {\n    return value.toUpperCase()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDevelopment Tips\n\nUse strict mode for better type safety. Leverage utility types for code reusability. Implement proper error handling with Result types. Use const assertions for better type inference.\n\nThese TypeScript best practices will help you create more robust, maintainable, and performant applications. Investment in strict configuration translates to fewer bugs and better developer experience.",
